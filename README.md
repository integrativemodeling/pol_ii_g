# Localizing gdown1 on POL II using integrative structure modeling

These scripts demonstrate the use of IMP and PMI in the modeling of the
Pol II(G) complex using DSS chemical cross-links.

## Input data (directory `data`):

40 DSS cross-links involving gdown1 were identified via mass spectrometry.
14 of these cross-links were intramolecular and 26 were intermolecular with
Pol II. The Pol II structure used was obtained from the PDB (code 5FLM);
it was determined primarily based on a cryo-EM density map at 3.4 √Ö resolution
(EMDB code: 3218) [Bernesky, 2016 Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16482).

Representation of gdown1 relied on (i) secondary structure and disordered
regions predicted by PSIPRED based on the gdown1 sequence
([Buchan et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkt381);
[Jones, 1999](https://doi.org/10.1006/jmbi.1999.3091)).

## Running the simulations (directory `production_scripts`)

  - `sample.py`: PMI modeling scripts for running the production simulations:
    The search for good-scoring models relied on Gibbs sampling, based on the
    Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm. We suggest producing at least 5 million
    models from 100 independent runs, each starting from a different initial
    conformation of gdown1 to have proper statistics.

  - `submit.sub`: SGE cluster based submission scripts to run automatically
    100 independent runs.

  - The compressed 100 independent trajectories are accessible at:
    `/salilab/park3/ganesans/gdown1_trajectories/gdown1.tar.gz`

## Analyzing the simulations (directory `analysis_scripts`)

Various scripts to analysis the simulations. We give more details scripts that
allows us to test for sampling convergence.

  - `select_good_scoring_models.py`: Python script that reads and selects
    RMF files based on good scoring model criteria explained in the methods
    section.

  - `random_subsets_best_score_convergence.py`: we test if adding more models
    improves our sampling of top scores. The input to the script is a list
    of all the `Total_Score` from the simulations. For each subset, we perform
    100 sub-samplings to compute error bars. We give the file twice to check
    how the error bars varies.

  - `Kolmogorov_Smirnov_2Samples.py`: we test if the distribution from two
    independent subsets are not unsimilar.

  - The good-scoring models that have been selected for precision-based
    clustering based on RMSD metric are located in: `results/Models`.
    The file name format is `${trajectory_number}_${frame_number}.rmf3`

  - `sample_precision.py`: Given a RMSD matrix
    (`results/Clustering/rmsd_matrix.tar.gz`), we compute the ùõò2-test for
    homogeneity of proportions{McDonald, 2014} and compute the best precision
    for which sampling has converged.

  - `rmsf.py`: Given a list of structures, compute the average RMSF, which
    indicates the precision of the structures in a cluster.

## Plotting the results (directory `plotting_scripts`)

Python scripts for generating figures from the paper.
